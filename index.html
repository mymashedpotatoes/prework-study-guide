          <li>Seperation of Concerns: Seperating code in different files based on use. "Each section of code has its own responsibilities.</li>
          <li>Selector defines element and attributes to which the rules and declaration apply.</li>
          <li>Margin indicates how much spare space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element. If 0 then NO extra space is around the element.</li>
          <li>Padding adds space around content INSIDE an element. Increased padding means bigger element.</li>
          <li>* applies rule to all elements visible on page.</li>
          <li>, combines 2 selectors into single rule. So you don't have to repeat the rule twice. DRY</li>
          <li>text-align: Centers title or heading on page.</li>
          <li>img: Assigns property values to any image element in markup.</li>
          <li>link: Creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>rel: Specifies the relationship between current document and the linked document resource.</li>
