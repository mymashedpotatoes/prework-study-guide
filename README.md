# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The modivation for this project was to help myself learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript before the bootcamp starts. Also, to keep all my notes in one place so I can look back on them. I built this project to condense everything I learned in the prework into one place. This project solves the problem of being over loaded with information because now it has everything important split into different categories and it smaller managable pieces. In this project I learned how to use the basics of Git, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript while also learning to manage my time.
